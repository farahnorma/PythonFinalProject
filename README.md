# PythonFinalProject

#In this project you will find a Database.txt file and a Historic_Dates.py file.

#The Historic_Dates.py file runs the program and uses the Database.txt file as a database.

#This project runs similarly to the Inventory program we worked on in class, where it prints options and users enter key
#commands to run the program.

#The program has three functions.
#1. It can search the database and print an event given a user inputted date.
#2. It can print out all currently stored events and the dates they occurred.
#3. It can allow users to add new events and dates to the database.

#Originally intended for fun, this program could be used as a task list. Where users can search what tasks they need to
#complete on or by a given date, they can see all current tasks needed to be completed, and they can add tasks. If it
#were to be used in that way however, the author would prefer to add more functions like a delete option for tasks.
